Nicolas Courty is Full Professor at <a href="http://www.univ-ubs.fr"> University Bretagne Sud</a> since 2018. He obtained his PhD degree in 2002 from INSA Rennes and his 'Habilitation à diriger des recherches' in. 2013, on the topic of computer graphics and animation (avatars, crowds), with a specialization in data-driven methods. He now leads the <a href="https://www-obelix.irisa.fr">Obelix</a> team in IRISA, dedicated to machine learning and its applications to Earth Observation. He is an experienced researcher in the domain of machine learning and AI. Among others, he has published several papers in top tier machine learning conferences (NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, AISTATS, etc.), computer vision (IEEE TPAMI, ECCV, ACCV) and remote sensing (IEEE TGRS, ISPRS journal). From 2014, he has developed an expertise in the domain of optimal transport and related applications to machine learning. He is also one of the recipients of the U.V. Helava Award, awarded by the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS), for the best paper in the ISPRS journal in years 2012--2015. Nicolas Courty is a member of the European ELLIS society. From 2020, he pilots an ANR Chair program on AI (OTTOPIA), on the topic of applied optimal transport for Remote Sensing.
